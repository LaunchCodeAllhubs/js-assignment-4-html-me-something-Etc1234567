      <h2> Countries I Want to Visit</h2>
      <h1> Japan </h1>
      <header> Reasons to Visit </header>
      <ul> 
         <li>Trying a traditional onsen </li>
            <img src = "images/onsen.jpg" alt= "A Japanese hot spring" width=50% height=50%>
               <p> If you haven't been to a natural hot spring, or <em>onsen</em> as they are known in Japan, I highly recommend visiting one! My first and only experience in a hot spring was when I studied abroad in Costa Rica, and they are a game changer. 
               Hot springs combine the relaxation of soaking in hot water with the health benefits of mineral water and the beauty of nature, so they are an amazing getaway.
               According to the BBC, there are over 3,000 onsen in Japan so they are an interesting and unique part of Japanese culture.
            </p>
         <li> Cherry Blossom Festival</li>
            <img src = "images/cherry-blossoms.jpg" alt= "Cherry Blossom Festival" width=50% height=50%>
               <p>Japan's Cherry Blossom Festival is world famous, for good reason. This two-week festival is a world-renowned celebration of Spring that can be enjoyed in many different areas, including Maruyama Park, Mount Yoshino, Himeji Castle, and Fuji Five Lakes.
               Spring is one of my favorite seasons, and I would love to experience this celebration.</p>
         <li> Tokyo</li>
            <img src="images/shibuya.jpg" alt="Shibuya Crossing" width=50% height=50%>
            <p> Having spent most of my life in Kansas City, I am familiar with city living but have never been to a large metropolis like Tokyo. I would love to visit Tokyo in real life to see if it lives up to its larger-than-life portrayal in pop culture. 
               Besides experiencing the hustle and bustle of a huge city, I am also curious about the culture in Tokyo and have seen a lot of really cool places featured on Instagram and in movies that I would like to visit.
               I could spend a long period of time exploring Tokyo and look forward to visiting here someday.
            </p>
         <li> Kyoto </li>
            <img src="images/kyoto.avif" alt="Kyoto street" width=50% height=50%>
               <p> Kyoto would expose me to another, more traditional side of Japan that I am curious to experience. It is stunningly beautiful and very different from anything I have ever experienced, so it is on my bucket list of places to visit.
                  As a history lover, I would like to learn more about Japan's history and traditions and believe this would be a great place to do this.
               </p>
      </ul>
      <footer> I would love to visit Japan because it has so much to offer and I want to try being immersed in another culture that is very different from my own.

      <h1> Iceland </h1>
      <header> Reasons to Visit</header>
      <ul>
         <li> Aurora Borealis</li>
         <img src="images/aurora.jpg" alt="Aurora Borealis" width=50% height=50%>
         <p> Wanting to see an aurora is a pretty self-explanatory reason to visit Iceland, and this country is a fantastic place to see this phenomena due to it being so far north!
         </p>
         <li> Waterfalls, Volcanos, Geysers, and more!</li>
            <img src="images/iceland-waterfall.jpg" alt="Waterfall in Iceland" width=50% height=50%>
         <p> Iceland is known for its rugged beauty and wild landscapes. Notable landmarks include waterfalls, geyers, volcanoes, hot springs, glaciers and much, much more. 
            I learned about Iceland from watching some BBC documentaries and doing some research when Kansas City had a direct flight to Iceland for a short period of time.
            I am hoping Iceland Air returns to our city so I can conveniently visit this majestic place. </p>
         <li> Blue Lagoon </li>
         <img src="images/blue-lagoon.jpg" alt="Blue Lagoon Hot Spring" width=50% height=50%>
         <p> If you've ever heard about Iceland on Instagram, the Blue Lagoon definitely was mentioned. This otherworldly-looking place is a natural hot spring that is a very popular tourist destination, and it is recommended to make reservations months in advance to ensure you can get in.
            The water is a milky-blue color due to a high concentration of silica and other minerals in the water, hence the name. 
         </p>
         <li> Glaciers </li>
         <img src="images/glacier.jpg" alt="Glacier in Iceland" width=50% height=50%>
         <p> My first experience with a glacier was Grinell Glacier at Glacier National Park, and it was an incredible experience <em> although a very tough hike! </em> 
         11% of Iceland consists of glaciers, and some are so large that they can be seen from space. In the age of global warming, it is especially important for me to visit glaciers and experience their beauty in case less of them exist in the future.
      Oftentimes, glaciers are also in beautiful, remote areas making the hike very memorable. </p>
      </ul>
      <footer> Iceland is high on my list of places to see because of its natural beauty!

      <h1> Italy </h1>
      <header> Reasons to Visit </header>
      <ul>
         <li> The Dolomites </li>
         <img src="images/dolomites.jpg" alt="Dolomites in Italy" width=50% height=50%>
         <p> I have wanted to visit the Dolomites ever since I saw a video of a travel vlogger hiking one of the peaks and seeing the peaks wrapped in clouds. Mountains are generally beautiful, but the Dolomites take it to a whole different level.
            They are a UNESCO World Heritage site and were once underwater, making for a very interesting history and untouched, beautiful surroundings. 
         </p>
         <li>Food and Wine</li>
         <img src="images/wine.jpg" alt="Italian wine" width=50% height=50%>
         <p> This is another self-explanatory reason for visiting Italy, but as a foodie I would be in heaven in this country. I am a big fan of Italian food and wine in the US and know I can expect it to be even better in Italy itself! 
         </p>
         <li>Rome, Tuscany, and Venice</li>
         <img src="images/venice.avif" alt="Canals in Venice" width=50% height=50%>
         <p> There are tons of historic cities to visit in Italy, and I am excited to experience each of them. It is always awe-inspiring to visit somewhere for the first time that you have only heard stories of or seen on the Internet.
         </p>
         <li> Art and History </li>
         <img src="images/trevi.avif" alt="Trevi Fountain" width=50% height=50%>
         <p> Italy has a rich history and culture that I would like to experience at its fullest. One aspect that I am very interested in is the art! </p>
      </ul>
      <footer> As a foodie, art lover, and history buff, Italy is naturally high on my list of places to visit. </footer>

      <h1> Spain </h1>
      <header> Reasons to Visit </header>
      <ul>
         <li> Madrid</li>
         <img src="images/flamenco.avif" alt="Flamenco performance" width=50% height=50%>
         <p> Madrid is the capital of Spain and is home to flamenco and Real Madrid FC, a world-famous soccer team. It is also notable for being the third largest city in the EU and is considered one of the centers of art in Spain. </p>
         <li> Valencia </li>
         <img src="images/valencia.avif" alt="Valencia landscape" width=50% height=50%>
         <p> I almost studied abroad in Valencia and have always wanted to visit. Valencia is a coastal city in Spain and it has a great university for biology, which I studied in college.
            Paella, a seafood and rice dish, originates from Valencia and it is considered one of the most livable cities in the world. Valencia is also known for its art and architecture. </p>
         <li> Tapas and Sangria</li>
         <img src="images/tapas.jpg" alt="Tapas on table" width=50% height=50%>
         <p> One of my favorite restaurants in Kansas City is La Bodega, and I have a weak spot for tapas and sangria. Enjoying tapas in Spain is high on my bucket list and something I hope to experience very soon.
            Tapas are an important aspect of Spanish culture and involve snacking on appetizers in an informal social setting, typically in the afternoon.
         </p>
         <li> History and Art</li>
         <img src="images/park-guell.jpg" alt="Mosaic Art in Park Guell" width=50% height=50%>
         <p> I already mentioned art multiple times in this Spain section and it is a large draw for me to this country. Spain has many recognizable and notable styles of art and an incredibly rich culture that I would like to experience first-hand.</p>
      </ul>
      <footer> Spain has all of my favorite things-- amazing food, art, beaches and a rich culture. From flamenco to enjoying paella, there are many things in Spain that I want to experience.</footer>

      <h1> Australia/New Zealand </h1>
      <header>Reasons to Visit </header>
      <ul>
         <li> Great Barrier Reef</li>
         <img src="images/great-barrier-reef.webp" alt="Great Barrier Reef" width=50% height=50%>
         <p> I am currently working on becoming scuba certified for the purpose of diving the Great Barrier Reef sometime during my life. I have learned a lot about it in school and seen lots of pictures and would love to experience it!
            It is the largest living thing on Earth, is visible from space, and is 2,300 km long! It is currently threatened due to climate change, so I want to see it sooner rather than later in order to experience it at its fullest.
         </p>
         <li> More sheep than people in New Zealand</li>
         <img src="images/sheep.jpg" alt="Sheep in New Zealand" width=50% height=50%>
         <p> One amusing fact is that there are more sheep than people in New Zealand, and I have always wanted to see all of the sheep in person! There are many other draws to New Zealand as well, like experiencing Maori culture, but I thought it would be fun to mention the sheep.
            National reserves make up 30% of New Zealand, meaning much of the island is beautiful, untouched nature.
         </p>
         <li> Cool and unique wildlife</li>
         <img src="images/koala.avif" alt="Koala in tree" width=50% height=50%>
         <p> As a biology student, it goes without saying that the flora and fauna of Australia are super fascinating and unique! It would be incredible to see these creatures in their natural setting, rather than at the zoo.
            Australia also has incredible landscapes and would be amazing to explore. 
         </p>
      </ul>
      <footer> Australia has always been on my list to visit but I haven't made it there due to the length of the flight. 
         Besides the culture, one of the big draws for me is the biology of the island. </footer>

       <p> There are &infin; other places that I would like to visit, so hopefully I get the chance to see them all! </p>
